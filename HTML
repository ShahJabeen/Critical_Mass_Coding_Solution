<!--
Let's play with Arrays!
1. Implement a function to remove all instances of a specified topping from a provided array. Demonstrate by removing 'pineapple' from the list of toppings. It should not mutate the original Array.
2. Implement a de-duplication function and pass the toppings Array through it. It should not mutate the original Array.
Bonus! Output de-duplicated list to the DOM as list elements.
